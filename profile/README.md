# GenomicBreeding

🧬🌱 Genomic breeding pipeline in Julia ∴ 

🧙 Functionalities:
- [X] genomic prediction assessment (replicated k-fold cross-validation)
- [X] genomic prediction *per se* (extraction of allele effects)
- [ ] genome-wide association study (**under development**)
- [ ] mating/crossing designs (**planned**)
- [ ] breeding simulations (**planned**)
- [ ] high-dimensional selection indices (**planned**)
- [ ] others...

🌱 Limitations:
- currently being designed for plant/crop breeding
- currently under heavy development without any stable releases ∴ see [docs|dev] instead of [docs|stable]
